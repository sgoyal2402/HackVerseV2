            <p class="w3-large">MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks) is the memory management technique in which each job gets just the amount of memory it needs.
                        That is, the partitioning of memory is dynamic and changes as jobs enter and leave the system.</p>
            <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"><b>Advantages</b>: In this scheme there is no internal fragmentation. This method is more flexible as variable size process can be given memory. there is no size limitation.<br>
                                                            <b>Disadvantages</b>: It also suffers from external fragmentation. In this scheme compile time address binding is not possible.</p>

            <h4><strong>Best Fit</strong></h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">The best fit deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the requirement of the requesting process. This algorithm first searches the entire list of free partitions and considers the smallest hole that is adequate. It then tries to find a hole which is close to actual process size needed.  Memory utilization is much better than first fit as it searches the smallest free partition first available. The problem with this method is it is slower and may even tend to fill up memory with tiny useless holes.</p><br>

            <h4><strong>First Fit</strong></h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">In the first fit approach is to allocate the first free partition or hole large enough which can accommodate the process. It finishes after finding the first suitable free partition. It is the fastest algorithm as it searches as little as possible. The problem with this method is that the remaining unused memory areas left after allocation goes to waste as it is too small to use.</p><br>

            <h4><strong>Worst Fit</strong></h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">In worst fit approach is to locate largest available free portion so that the portion left will be big enough to be useful. It is the reverse of best fit. This method helps reduce the rate of production of small gaps. The disadvantage is that if a process requiring larger memory arrives at a later stage then it cannot be accommodated as the largest hole is already split and occupied.</p><br>
